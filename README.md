# MovieLibrary

A webpage that loads movie titles from a directory of video files, retrieves the movie information (title, director, actors etc) as well as the movie poster (from the 'internet movie database' https://imdb.com) and displays each movie in a Netflix style on screen for browsing.

The movies can also be sorted by various variables (such as by genre, by year released etc) and can also be searched (for example searching all movies that are directed by Christopher Nolan).
